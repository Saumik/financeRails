For MySQL: Innotop, Maatkit. Support for Percona

Clustering vs. Sharding. Automatic vs. manual distribution

When sharing:
Lose Join, no unique capability. ID Lookup is built in into the ID structure and no central allocation service.

MysQL stores blobs - JSON and thinking Serialized thrift - Saves migrations across many service.

Pyres - resque queue with scripting farm to move items across shards. And all background tasks run on it.

redis is quirky and new. memcache is easy and more performant sometimes. also (timestamp, updates to id)

Analytics: Cafka, EMR, (throw logs and analyze it with Amazon MAp Reduce Hourly). Statstie (performance)

Looking into handlesocket. Sendgrid for sending emails
